# Indented Sass syntax highlighting, autocomplete & snippets for VSCode
VSCode only has built in support for SCSS syntax so I have put this together for people who use the indented syntax.
~~When opening a .sass file the syntax should set to _Sass (Indented)_, using just _Sass_ clashes with the built in support unfortunately (Which should be Scss IMO)~~

**As of 1.3 the built in support id has been renamed from ```sass``` to ```scss``` meaning I have been able to drop ```-indented``` from the language id. The extension now requires a minimum VSCode version 1.4. If you have any issues please update your VSCode first.**

### Installing
Search for Sass from the extension installer within VSCode or put this into the command palette   
```
ext install sass-indented
```

### Autocompletion & Emmet
Autocompletion for css properties and built in language functions _(@warn, @at-root, lighten(), darken() etc)_ is now built in. As of version 1.3 VSCode supports Emmet in .sass files, the original snippets for css properties have been removed.

### Snippets
Snippets have been reduced to a few time savers.

```var``` - declare a new variable   
```mixin``` - declare a new mixin   
```if``` - base for an @if statement   
```for``` - base for a @for loop   
```each``` - base for a @each loop   
```while``` - base for a @while loop
